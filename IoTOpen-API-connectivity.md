### What is IoTOpen 

IoT Open is a generic platform for IoT applications. It is in use in several industries with multiple use cases. From monitoring homes to whole cities as well as boats and many other appliances.

IoT Open has an easy-to-use API and is really fast and scalable. Even though it is very easy to use, it is very flexible. It is very easy to build applications around it.

IoT Open also has built-in functionality for edge intelligence. It is possible to connect edge clients to the platform and write applications targeted to run on the clients. This open up for great possibilities to build scalable distributed applications running on different locations in the solution.

### How it is used in GeoFencing project
GeoFencing project uses sensors fixed on various vehicles to send data about **time** and **vehicle co-ordinates**. All the sensors are configured to send data to IoT Open platform, where data is being filtered, stored and made available through various API end points. This makes it easier to process this data and generate meaning ful information out of it without worrying about storing them securely and other compliance requirements.
